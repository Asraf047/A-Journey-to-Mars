# A-Journey-to-Mars

Is it actually possible to survive in the MARS?

Before answering this question, let us know you how much favorable the world is. There is a huge arguments about it.
Petranek says, “Humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth. We will never be the last of our kind.” So, human are searching alternative ways to survive.

MARS may be the alternative solution. Michio Kaku says “There is only one way for Humanity to survive. Go To Mars.”
We are here TEAM RADIANT to work with MARS, the red planet near earth, which’s distance is 225 million km on average. For exploring mars we need to know about mars, it’s climate, it’s environment, it’s inconvenience and everything else. And we going to give you this opportunity through our 3D virtual model where you can act like an astronauts with the features pre-described by NASA like space suit, habitation facilities, landing zone, power zone etc.

MARS- the Terrestrial type of planet is so small that if the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet. It completes the orbit around the sun in 687 days. This rocky planet having a solid surface has been altered by volcanos, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions. This is a very tough place for life as it's thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, argon, nitrogen and a small amount of oxygen and water vapor.
In this interesting project, the player will get the feel of landing on the real MARS, having a life there. By doing so, a lot of problems can be identified as surviving there as well as the solutions.

Services this project will provide:

•	As NASA has proved the possibility of survival in MARS, our project is to make people believe that it is actually possible.

•	Give people real life feel as an astronaut exploring MARS. Make the simulation of the planet looks like actually it is.

•	Explore MARS using data given by NASA.

This is a kind of simulator for real-life exploration of MARS, which will make the visitor like real life experienced about the planet MARS which is considered the second planet that humans can consider as a backup plan.

Future Plan:

•	Adding more challenges like dust storm, features like night mood, and including stars and other planets beside MARS.

•	Make the visitor how it feels like astronauts in MARS.

So, it's high time, pack your bag and explore MARS through our project.
