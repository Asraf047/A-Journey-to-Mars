# A-Journey-to-Mars

Is it actually possible to survive in the MARS?

Before answering this question, let us know you how much favorable the world is. There is a huge arguments about it.
Petranek says, “Humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth. We will never be the last of our kind.” So, human are searching alternative ways to survive.

MARS may be the alternative solution. Michio Kaku says “There is only one way for Humanity to survive. Go To Mars.”
We are here TEAM RADIANT to work with MARS, the red planet near earth, which’s distance is 225 million km on average. For exploring mars we need to know about mars, it’s climate, it’s environment, it’s inconvenience and everything else. And we going to give you this opportunity through our 3D virtual model where you can act like an astronauts with the features pre-described by NASA like space suit, Habitation Area, Research Zone, Primary Landing Zone, Power Zone etc and sky (after removed Orange filter).

Services this project will provide:

•	As NASA has proved the possibility of survival in MARS, our project is to make people believe that it is actually possible.

•	Give people real life feel as an astronaut exploring MARS. Make the simulation of the planet looks like actually it is.

•	Explore MARS using data given by NASA.

This is a kind of simulator for real-life exploration of MARS, which will make the visitor like real life experienced about the planet MARS which is considered the second planet that humans can consider as a backup plan.

Future Plan:

•	Adding more challenges like dust storm, features like night mood, and including stars and other planets beside MARS.

•	Make the visitor how it feels like astronauts in MARS.

So, it's high time, pack your bag and explore MARS through our project.

Tools:

Our project is implemented using:

•	Unreal Engine

•	Blender

•	SketchUp

•	CMake
